## The original driver's speed table (TController::TableTraceRoute(), TableUpdate(),
## TableUpdateEvent(), TSpeedPos, Driver.cpp:190-1727): what lies on the tracks ahead of the
## trainset - the track limits, the switches, the end of the line, and the passive events the
## scenery speaks to drivers with (a `putvalues`/`getvalues` of SetVelocity, ShuntVelocity,
## OutsideStation, ...; ScenarioEventServer.event_is_passive()) - and what it makes of them: the next
## speed and how far it is (VelNext, ActualProximityDist), the speed at the next signal
## (VelSignalNext), a limit of the speed wanted, and the orders the driver gives itself when it sees
## a signal (SetVelocity, ShuntVelocity) or reaches a memory's command.
##
## As the original, the table is kept between updates: traced once, moved as the trainset drives,
## traced on at its end as the reach needs, traced again from a switch thrown ahead, and the events
## the front reaches take effect once (TableCheck(), TableTraceRoute()). The passenger stops
## (`PassengerStopPoint:`) are driven by the timetable (TableUpdateStopPoint()). Behind the trainset
## it looks only for a signal to turn back to (backward_scan()). Not ported yet: the section and road
## speeds, stopping at an automatic block signal (spStopOnSBL), the crossings - see TODO.md, "Drivers".
