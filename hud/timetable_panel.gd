extends PanelContainer

## The timetable of the player's train: the train, its relation, the clock and the delay, and every
## station with the times it is due - the original's timetable panel (timetable_panel::update(),
## driveruipanels.cpp:300-472; F2, driveruilayer.cpp:155) laid out anew. It shows the timetable of
## the trainset the player's vehicle belongs to: the scenario gives it to one driver of the
## trainset only, not necessarily the one of the vehicle the player sits in.

## The close button asks the owner of the View menu to hide the panel and untick its entry
signal close_requested
## The player's train was given a timetable (or the player drives one that has it): the owner of the
## View menu shows the panel
signal timetable_received
