## SN61-02 told by the scenery to couple up to the SN61 it stands against - `Shunt -3 -99`, as
## calkowo's shunting events say it (events_noc_zimowa.ctr:1398). 99 asks for the heating line too,
## and no SN61 coupler has one (AllowedFlag=39): the driver joined what the two couplers can join and
## then asked for the heating line for ever, standing in its CONNECT order (report 2026-10-09,
## calkowo SN61 at night). The original's Attach() sets the asked couplings whatever the couplers
## allow (Mover.cpp:576-583), so its UpdateConnect() ends there (Driver.cpp:7028).
##
## Followed by events, not by time: a `coupler_connect` sent once the vehicles are joined by all they
## can join is the deadlock; `driver_order_changed` to an order past CONNECT is the end of it.
