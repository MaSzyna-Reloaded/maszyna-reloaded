## The AI driver prepares the REAL EP07-424 (ep07.scn, its own .fiz and .mmd) for the road through
## its cab, to the end of the start sequence: low voltage, line breaker, converter
## (Driver.cpp PrepareEngine). The tester's report of 2026-10-04 had the driver stop at the line
## breaker; test_driver_server.gd checks the order only up to the battery, on a diesel.

## EP07-424 of td.scn on a cut of its line, with the EP07's own .fiz and .mmd (demo/tests/fixtures)

## The driver's update the converter comes on with: the battery and the pantographs on the first,
## the line breaker closed on the fourth, its button held over InitialCtrlDelay between them, the
## converter on the fifth (8.1 s measured) - each PREPARE_TIME after the one before, the first
## within PREPARE_TIME of the order
