description: Make a pre-release (pre-alpha) promo screenshot of MaSzyna Reloaded with the loading screen logo and the build number in one consistent look. Use when the operator gives an in-game screenshot and asks to put the logo and/or the build number (from a maszyna-reloaded.pl changelog link) on it.

# Pre-release screenshot

Every release screenshot uses the same layout. Do not invent a new one; only the vertical
position changes from shot to shot.

## Layout

* **One line across the frame:** the logo on the left and the build number on the right, at the
  same height. The logo is centred on the digits.
* **Logo:** `loading_screen/logo.png` (the loading screen's), trimmed, 400 px wide, 44 px
  from the left edge.
* **Build number:** Noto Sans Black, 96 px, `#e6edfc`, right-aligned 44 px from the right edge.
  Only the number goes in the big text (`20261003-1708`).
* **Label above it:** `PRE-ALPHA BUILD`, Noto Sans SemiBold, 22 px, letter-spaced, `#73b8ff`,
  right-aligned. The colours are the `Scenery` and `Eyebrow` labels of `loading_board.tscn`.
* **Shadow:** a soft, heavily blurred dark ellipse under each side, so the text reads on any
  background. No hard box edges.

The sizes are for 1920x1080; the script scales them to the input's width.

## Steps

1. Get the build number from the changelog link (WebFetch). The page title reads
   `... Pre-Alpha <date> (build <id>)`; use `<id>`. The link's last path segment is usually the
   same id.
2. Look at the screenshot and pick the line's height: below the HUD and the main subject,
   above the bottom HUD (speed bar, vehicle card) and not over people's heads or faces. The
   first approved shot used `760`: just above the head of a person walking along the bottom.
3. Compose:

   ```bash
   .claude/skills/prerelease-screenshot/compose.sh <input.png> <build> <output.png> [line_top_y] [label]
   ```

   `line_top_y` is the top of the build number in 1080p pixels (default 760). `label` defaults to
   `PRE-ALPHA BUILD`.
4. Read the output image and check it. If the number covers a figure or the HUD, change only
   `line_top_y`. Do not change sizes, fonts or colours.
5. Save next to the original as `<name>_build.png`. Never overwrite the operator's original.
