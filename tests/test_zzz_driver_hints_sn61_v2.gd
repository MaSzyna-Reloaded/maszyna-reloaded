## SN61-02 (pkp/sn61_v2, fixtures/scenery/startup_sn61-02.scn, the rear cab of calkowo_sn61_zima.scn)
## driven the way a player drives it: started by nothing but the driving aid's hints, top to bottom,
## each by the key the hints window shows beside it (DriverHints); moved off by the master
## controller as a player moves off; then stopped by the independent brake alone. The SN61 starts
## only off position 0 (R = 0, dizel_StartupCheck(), Mover.cpp:7063-7069), so a list that leads to
## the line breaker with the controller at 0 never gets there.

## while its key is down (CabinLogic, KNOB_KEY_SPEED), and the line breaker closes only after the
## SN61's InitialCtrlDelay (1.5 s) of holding (Train.cpp:8438-8472) - held over that
const KEY_HOLD:float = 2.0
## Simulated seconds the driver is given to update its list after a step (its reaction time)
const DRIVER_UPDATE_SECONDS:float = 5.0
## The speed the player drives up to before braking [km/h]

## Simulated seconds the independent brake has to stop the vehicle from DRIVING_SPEED
