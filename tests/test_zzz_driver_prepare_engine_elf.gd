## The AI driver prepares EN76-001 (elf_v1, fixtures/scenery/startup_en76-001-a.scn, cut from
## Wrzosy's ic8310_dekoracje.scm: four cars, the A car with pantograph A and the D car with
## pantograph B, each of them powered with a line breaker of its own) to the end of the start
## sequence. The original asks for both pantographs, consist-wide, and
## takes one as raised by the pantograph unit's valve of it (Driver.cpp:2811-2813,
## driverhints.cpp:269-310); the B cars' line breakers count for its readiness
## (Driver.cpp:6143-6144). Told to go, it puts its Elf controller (EIMCtrlType=2) at the driving
## position at once, as the original sets MainCtrlPos (Driver.cpp:3784, 4289); stepped through the
## cab on every update, the relay time started again and the power never rose past its first step
## (CheckEIMIC(), Mover.cpp). Report 2026-10-10 (Wrzosy, IC EIE8310): the EN76 stood at "prepare the
## vehicle", its D car's pantograph never raised, and then at "increase tractive force"; the
## scenario waiting for it never went on.
